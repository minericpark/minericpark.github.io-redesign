# Hey!

My name is **Eric Park**, though my friends call me **Min**, a short form to my Korean traditional name Min Seo.<br />
I am a **Software Engineering Co-op** student at the *University of Guelph*, expecting graduation in the Winter of 2023.

## Personal

I am a:

- Student
- Developer
- Dancer

I'm a pretty sociable person, but I'm often busy with my own time: usually developing something behind the scenes, learning 
new skills, pumping iron, planning investments; all to maintain my productivity and abilities in consideration of my long-term goals.
Otherwise, I'm often out hanging out with friends, dancing somewhere, taking class, freestyle-sessioning, or in rehearsal 
(though with how the pandemic is going, dancing has been pretty inactive to say the least). 
<br />

## Career

I'm pretty much in a journey-man mode. I seek to figure out what sort of niche development I enjoy most, while continuously
putting out my best effort and work into my career. 

I got into software development during the current *COVID19 pandemic*. It sounds funny, especially since I've been enrolled 
into the program for 2 years now, but I like being able to help people through software. Even putting out anything remotely
useful is satisfying to me, as long as it has some sort of purpose.

Whether I go into something specific like cyber security or full-stack development is something I'm still determining by experiencing
and learning continuously. However the purpose remains simple: support, assist or protect people through technological means.

I am also pursuing a minor in Psychology due to its potential use in understanding people's needs and effectively what they want. 
By understanding this, I hope to become more successful and influential in any development I take part in.
