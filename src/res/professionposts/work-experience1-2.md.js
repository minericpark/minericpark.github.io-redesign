- Developed iOS/Android game "Color Jiggle" with team in Agile work environment
- Designed and tested puzzles by writing data in JSON files
- Cooperated and maintained daily communication with team through project management tools (GitHub, Trello, Slack)

Personal experience: Honestly this was a bit of a hard time for me. I wanted to get into the coding but I was basically outmatched
by other students that the employer had found at the time. I ended up learning a good amount of project management tools, experienced
an agile development cycle with a team, and received some exposure to C# and coding libraries. Also improved my teamwork and 
collaboration skills in general.
