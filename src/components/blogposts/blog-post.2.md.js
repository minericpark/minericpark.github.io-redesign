# Second Update and Thoughts

#### December 26, 2020 by [Min](/)

Hello!

Wow this sure has been a while.

This is my first blogpost on my redesigned website, and I kind of wanted to go over my process of the full creation.

Despite my previous website looking pretty good with all its fancy animation, I found the webpage architecture to be a 
bit primitive so I decided to re-create my webpage using a different set of technical tools. I'm still an amateur programmer
within the industry, so I don't have much exposure to the web development field. However, I'm doing my best to pick up what
I can, and applying it to the best of my ability.

## The Tech Stack

Specifically, I utilized the *ReactJS* and *Material UI* libraries and framework for my front-end. There currently is no back-end as I have
just realized that *Github Pages* hosting doesn't seem to allow for a back-end server to run. A majority of the code is written in *Javascript*,
with *HTML5* and *CSS3* injections within the framework. 

There exists no real back-end code within this project. No object-oriented principles were utilized for the development due to my uncertainty
of its possible implementation within a front-end framework. A majority of the skills learned were from the *Material UI* tutorial website, 
various *YouTube* videos, and support from friends. Otherwise, it was a lot of experimentation with the tools available.

## My Reflection

I took on the website redesign as a method to get back into programming as an active skillset to work on. Throughout the pandemic, when school
had been disrupted, I took the time to rethink about my focus in my life. It gave me some motivation and clarity on my career and life purpose,
and so I decided to put more work into my daily routine. 

Despite completing a majority of this website already, I feel a bit upset with the lack of learning that I had done. Despite getting into a
language I'm not too familiar with (*Javascript*) and utilizing new tools, I don't feel as if this was valuable in a way. My programming knowledge
and library knowledge may have improved, however my core fundamentals haven't. 

I feel like working hard isn't enough. Despite that, it's all I do. 

My philosophy is that learning properly is always best. Work properly. Only then will I grow and improve, and create a strong impact on the industry.

The only issue is. I'm not sure how to. I'm very ill-equipped when it comes to learning and as a result, am not very well-versed in learning
programming in a self-sustaining manner. Usually a mentor is the easiest and quickest method I've experienced to learn things properly, but I'm clearly
hesitating about investing money into that. 

Soon enough, I may though. It's my most efficient way in learning effectively. Before I make a decision like that though, I need to consider all my
other options. But I shouldn't take too much time thinking about it. Time to check my resources and determine my best course of action.
