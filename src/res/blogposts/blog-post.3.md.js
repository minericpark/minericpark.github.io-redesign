As part of the occasional blog posts I will make, I will also be including my work term reports for academic purposes.

I will begin by clarifying firstly that for each of these reports, I plan to follow a blog-like style of describing my 
experience and my goals with each of my work experiences. I hope that through a blog post, I will be able to convey my 
time with this following company, and that through each post I make per term, a clear trend of growth can be seen with my efforts.

## Information about the employer
NCR Corporation is an American fintech company that provides both software and hardware solutions for banking and commerce 
needs. As a leading maker of transactional software services, ATMs, and POS devices, NCR is a very reputable enterprise 
that much of the general public can recognize. 

## Job Description
As a Software Developer intern at NCR, I was immediately put into a team in order to aid in development. Within that 
team, named Spectrum, most of my time was spent on feature implementation for the transactional service *SmartLockers*. 
This would involve constant collaboration and discussion of design, programming microservice endpoints and API + E2E testing. 
On top of these tasks, I was often both learning from and teaching other teammates development tools and deployment utilities. 
With this co-op term, I was given a thorough learning experience to several valuable industry-relevant software development 
tools and practices. 

## Goals
I had several goals that I had planned during the work term:

1. Firstly, I planned to become more technologically literate. Specifically, I wanted to become more familiar with relevant 
industry technologies.
  * In reflection to this work term I’ve completed, I can confidently say that I have most definitely learned far more development 
and deployment tools than I expected. Broadly, I have become far more familiar and more comprehensive of industry-relevant concepts 
like RESTful APIs, NoSQL databases, namespace maintenance and SCRUM Agile development. However, in specifics, I have learned 
to utilize and develop efficiently with these frameworks and tools:
    * Languages
      * Java
      * CQL
      * YAML
    * Development
      * Microservice
        * Sprint Boot (API Framework)
        * Swagger/OpenAPI (API Tool)
        * ElasticSearch (Search Engine)
        * Cassandra (DB)
      * Testing
        * Cucumber (BDD Framework)
        * JUnit (Testing Framework)
        * Postman (API Platform)
        * DBeaver (DB Platform)
      * Deployment
        * Shell Scripts
        * Docker
        * Kubernetes
        * Jenkins
        * Git
        * GCP

2. Second, improving my problem solving abilities with design, programming and testing was vital.
  * Despite my determination in accomplishing this goal, a discussion between my mentor and I made me realize that this goal 
was so general and so broad, that ultimately it wouldn’t be possible for me to truly understand and notice any improvements 
of such abilities through a single work term. To truly accomplish this task, I must keep it in mind throughout my journey 
overall and continue to push myself into different development experiences. Perhaps in my final co-op work term post, I 
will recap and summarize my progress with this story.

3. Third, I intended on improving my openness and warmth in communication with my team.
  * In reflection, my communication was very strong since the first day. I was taking every opportunity to be very collaborative, 
understanding, willing and open to all my teammates. It was important that I gained their trust, and equally vital that I 
didn’t emit stress or uncertainty, that could affect the team’s overall environment. Especially with development, communication 
is so vital as it is ingrained in every part of the process of implementation, design, and more. 

4. Fourth, learning and applying teamwork strategies and approaches to designing, testing and programming seemed like a 
great idea to improve my ability in working with teams.
  * This goal was difficult to accomplish mostly due to the fact that the entire team was working remote. Whereas designing 
was often conducted in collaboration through discussion and standards, I believe an office environment would have certainly 
improved the potential for applying teamwork strategies with testing and programming. Ultimately, this was a goal I was 
not able to see through during this work term. This, however, does not mean that I wasn’t able to learn effective collaboration .

5. Finally, I wanted to improve my overall awareness of the economy and industry.
  * Another discussion between my mentor and I helped me understand that I would only be able to achieve this goal through 
various experiences at other workplaces. With NCR, I have certainly become more aware of the financial tech industry and 
practices. However, with general software development, financial tech is only a part of the massive tech industry within 
the world. This is another kind of overarching goal that I will have to monitor throughout each of my co-op experiences, 
and ultimately evaluate at the end of my program duration.

## Conclusions
Overall, I'm very pleased with how everything went. Working at NCR was a massive learning experience for me, and certainly
the experience I needed to get over my imposter syndrome. There were moments where I was struggling and taking plenty of 
time out of my day to fix something, moments where I began piecing knowledge together and understanding how to develop 
these features; all which led up to a point where I knew exactly what to do with my tasks by the end of the first half of 
the term. Becoming more exposed and employing several new libraries, learning some basics of DevOps, a formal team 
development environment, and lots of hands-on experience has really improved my knowledge of REST API endpoint development, 
and ultimately my confidence.

I am really glad I decided to push myself into actual development work as soon as I could. I have my friends to thank for 
also inspiring me to do the same. With a majority of my work term involved in actual industry-level development, I'm proud 
enough to say I've done a memorable bit of contribution to the SmartLocker project. I'm excited to see it someday being 
used by major bank retailers, and will long remember my involvement with the product.
