- Developed requested React application features for clients including TopHat Robotics
- Improved stability and runtime of clients' applications by 25% through debugging and memoization of React components
- Used TypeScript, NestJS, TypeORM, GraphQL and MariaDB to create a web application prototype to overhaul and migrate an aging software solution for a financial services client
- Led a pitch of the prototype to the financial services client and the team, resulting in initiating full app production
- Researched and advised potential frameworks and libraries for Phase 1 solution design, leading to implementation of project with the suggested technologies
- Built a CI/CD pipeline for the financial services client prototype using BitBucket Pipelines, Docker and AWS EC2
- Implemented GraphQL API features for Phase 1 solution for financial services client

### Personal experience
I had hoped for a big learning experience from a smaller-scale company than NCR, and CSI didn't disappoint at all. It actually
overachieved way more than I expected, with the breadth of different areas of software development I ended up getting involved
in. I learned about and used way more Cloud tools (AWS: CodeDeploy, EC2, CodeArtifact), worked with and wrote DevOps tools
(Pipeline files, Caching, BitBucket Pipelines), worked for clients with Front-end tools (React, Memoization, Caching, new React libraries),
and developed several different prototypes based on this big client that we had recently secured a contract with. Prototypes
included a NestJS GraphQL application using TypeORM + MariaDB, a Microsoft Word Add-in to experiment on a potential front-end,
and a CLI that directly accessed the server. 

The research that I, and my fellow co-op student had done, eventually led to the adoption of the technologies (libraries, 
frameworks, development practices, automation, etc.) that we had recommended for the Phase 1 iteration of the project. 
This was hugely fulfilling, as it had meant our prototyping and research had paid off very successfully. Honestly, as much
as I like corporate work with all the organization and specific definition of tasks, the small company / startup environment
was actually very enjoyable. Constant learning and challenge often paved my improved resistance to stress and continued effort
into completing my tasks, and accomplishing more. Being forced to organize and discipline myself further for the advancement
of the project was also super fulfilling, and validated my investment and enjoyment in working with the company.

I'm excited to see how the Phase 1 solution of the final project developes. Contributing massively to a project further 
increased my active interest in it, and I'd maybe even like to return to see how it ended, or what other projects are up.
