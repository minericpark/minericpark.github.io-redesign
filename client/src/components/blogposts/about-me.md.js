# Hey!

My name is **Eric Park**, though my friends call me **Min**, a short form to my Korean traditional name Min Seo.

I am a **Software Engineering Co-op** student at the *University of Guelph*, expecting graduation in the Winter of 2023.

## Personal

I am a:

- Student
- Programmer
- Dancer

I'm not the most sociable person, but I'm always down to talk about anything with anybody as long as I'm not busy. I often engage in my own
activities and maintain my productivity and abilities in consideration of my long-term goals, so I can seem pretty distant from everything.
Otherwise, I'm often out dancing somewhere, taking class, freestyle-sessioning, or in rehearsal. I'll also be working on funny projects
that can teach me some relevant skills with friends out of enjoyment.


## Career

I got into software development as I began considering my purpose in life. Through a lot of soul searching in the *COVID19 pandemic*,
despite already being enrolled into the program, I determined that I wanted to be able to help people the best through software.
Whether I go into something specific like cyber security or full-stack development is something I'm still determining by experiencing
and learning continuously. However the purpose remains simple: be able to support, assist and protect people through a technological means.

I am currently working on my personal website and other projects, preparing for my fall co-op work term, and maintaining my school studies
so I can manage my degree and workload freely. I am excited to begin my first co-op position at *NCR* as a *Software Developer*, and plan to
do my very best in learning from them and working with them.

I am also pursuing a minor is Psychology due to its potential use in understanding people's needs and effectively what they want. 
By understanding this, I hope to become more successful and influential in any development I take part in.
