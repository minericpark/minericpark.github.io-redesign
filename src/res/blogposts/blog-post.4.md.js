## Information about the employer
Clear Software Inc. is a Canadian custom full-stack software development company. Based in Waterloo Ontario, Clear provides 
clients from around the world with effective customized software through careful planning and collaboration.

## Job Description
As a Software Developer intern at Clear, I was first tasked with responding to client tickets based on adjusting applications 
and fixing bugs. This involved constant discussion and review based on React components, hooks, and clients. 

Eventually, I was placed into conducting research, developing prototypes (full-stack, add-on, CLI, pipelines, use of cloud tools, etc.), 
and providing help in the decision making of the design and technical stack of a brand-new financial services client’s legal 
system. During this period, I was constantly learning brand new libraries, web protocols, development practices, and software 
tools. Often learning independently, I would then compile reports of my findings, and present them to the team. 

Finally, I was tasked along with other co-workers in developing the Stage 1 product of the financial services client’s software 
solution; the project we were prototyping for. Throughout this time, I was often busy developing back-end features, discussing 
specifications and requirements with the product manager, and seeking review and feedback based on my work. 

Through this co-op term, I was provided several independent learning opportunities which aided in my growth as a developer,
along with experience in developing with industry-relevant software development tools. 

## Goals
I had several goals that I had planned during the work term:

1. Firstly, I planned to improve my research and leadership skills by challenging myself with tasks I had absolutely no knowledge on.
  * By conducting several research tasks and compiling reports heavily depended upon by the team, I believe I have slightly improved 
  my research abilities. Despite providing valid knowledge to my team, I was never able to compile a complete knowledge set 
  that would provide all the proper and vital knowledge of the tools. I learned that in time, I would begin to understand 
  more of the tool which would prompt changes to my reports and teachings. As more requirements are presented, more was 
  learned and eventually understood through practice, and led to better quality research documents and prototypes

2. Then, I sought to learn new languages and frameworks to improve my technical knowledge and allow myself to prioritize on logic 
and creative problems.
  * I have learned several new technical tools that are industry-relevant including GraphQL, NestJS, ORMs, SQL databases, 
  and monorepo development and maintenance. I have also improved several previous tools learned, mentioned as part of the list below:
    * I have improved with and learned both new (marked with !) and old tools. These include:
        * Languages

                    * Services
                        * Repository design
                * TypeORM

                    * !  Key rotation

            * ! Microsoft Word Add-in
                * ! Office.js
                * ! Docxtemplater

                * ! MacOS development
                * Linux development


3. Moreover, I wanted to learn new technical concepts and architectures of applications to improve both my knowledge and 
decision making for designs
  * Despite plenty of input and research being conducted for the design of the application, I was unable to get involved 
  into the architecture design of the application due to it already being established. Otherwise, I have improved my knowledge 
  with SQL databases including relevant topics such as data-at-rest encryption, data-in-transit encryption, intermediate relationships, and more. 

4. Additionally, improving my online communication overall was my goal in preparing myself for a fully remote workplace, 
something which I anticipate could eventually happen in the future.
  * I have improved on this despite the lack of communication occurring very often. Considering a large chunk of my 
  work term was researching and independent prototype development, most of my communication was in communicating my findings, 
  the prototype results, personal input on technical stack choices, and more. Requesting help and clarification from seniors 
  was never a problem, nor from the other co-op student available..

5. Finally, further improving my time management and personal organization skills is a personal goal in which would help 
me improve my efficiency and effectiveness with work.
  * I have improved in this despite some bumps in the roads. Whenever burnout would occur, my productivity would slow 
  quite a bit and I would often feel forced to dredge on with my tasks. On the other hand, I aimed to complete my tasks as 
  soon as possible, with as much accuracy and understanding as I could commit. This would often lead to tickets being completely 
  in a quick and timely manner, which seemed to please our supervisors.

## Conclusions
At times, burn out would occur due to intense personal pressure and frustration from personal impatience. Despite this, 
I’ve learned to simply allow things to be, and that determination could be separate from all the personal expectations I’ve 
placed on myself. Through this, I developed a much more positive outlook on development, and continue to push through problems 
like bugs, strange error messages, and more. 

In my opinion, this was certainly my greatest learning experience in breadth. Exposure to several different technical libraries 
and tools, along with improvements in those I was already familiar with, and the involvement DevOps, Cloud, Front-end and Back-end 
development allowed me to branch out into many new career paths that I didn’t think would be possible in one co-op term, 
much less in two. Though this could be attributed to the fact that I had been researching and prototyping for most of my term, 
a good amount of this development had been done under review of the experienced developers and leaders of Clear Software. 
Additionally, some of this exposure had been done through client work, providing a bit more credibility to the work accomplished. 
Though depth of some technical skill or specialty may be more attractive in the industry, my intention with co-op was always 
to figure out what specialty or field I would truly enjoy in the industry. Without knowing what I’d like, I could have possibly 
ended up miserable or unfulfilled following a single path that I could have stayed on. Thanks to this, I’m certainly far 
more confident in attempting other types of development throughout my software career and have only begun to understand which 
specific fields I enjoy.


## Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my fellow team members at Clear Software that I have worked with closely: Evan Cooper (another UofG 
co-op that I coincidentally knew from prior classes haha), Mason Doerr, and Steve Grinyer. Through their confidence and 
willingness in me, and the opportunities and big responsibilities provided, I’ve learned to work more independently and 
fearlessly than before and expanded my insights a bit wider.
