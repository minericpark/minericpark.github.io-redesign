# Software Developer @ NCR
#### September 2020 - December 2020 in Waterloo, ON

NCR Corporation is an American fintech company that provides
financial software and services to banks, retailers and small
businesses.

- Designed and developed features for financial transaction product 'SmartLocker' as part of team Spectrum of TxPreStage
- Primarly implemented and tested organization and branch maintenance REST API endpoints (microservice and orchestration)
- Collaborated and communicated daily with team developers, product owners and product architects to determine product requirements
- Presented demos for several endpoints that were personally implemented at the end of sprints to the team

### Personal experience
This was great. Exactly the kind of learning curve I was seeking. There were moments where I was struggling 
and taking plenty of time out of my day to fix something, moments where I began piecing knowledge together and understanding 
how to develop these features; all which led up to a point where I knew exactly what to do with my tasks by the end of the 
first half of the term. Becoming more exposed and employing several new libraries, learning some basics of DevOps, a formal 
team development environment, and lots of hands-on experience has really improved my knowledge of REST API endpoint development, 
and ultimately my confidence.

I am really glad I decided to push myself into actual development work as soon as I could. I have my friends to thank for
also inspiring me to do the same. With a majority of my work term involved in actual industry-level development, I'm proud
enough to say I've done a memorable bit of contribution to the SmartLocker project. I'm excited to see it someday being used
by major bank retailers, and will long remember my involvement with the product.
